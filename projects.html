                    This one is my pride and joy. I am continually building this, and it isn't quite operational yet.
                    I am taking inspiration from 17th century Safavid cultural elements in order to create an authentic, respectful representation of Middle Eastern fantasy.
                    This worldbuilding project derives a fictional religion based on Zoroastrian polytheism and parallels are made to Abrahamic figures.
                    Many of the naming conventions are derived from Arabic, Creole, and Nahouatl (ancient Mayan) language, in an effort to keep consistent cultures within this world.
                    This game is a thought experiment for me, as well. I am challenging tropes of "evil races". Ogres, trolls, and goblins are not born to be killed.
                    They are treated as others in Western media. In my world, they have values, desires, and souls. The player will navigate their own xenophobia, or they will not.
                    This game will accomodate both approaches to things not easily understood. The point of this world is to try and understand the "enemy" in the midst of violence.
                    
                    In the end, I hope to highlight who our enemies truly are, and make parallels to the real world.
